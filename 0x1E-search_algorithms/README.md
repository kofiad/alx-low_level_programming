## Description

In this directory, you will find different search algorithms implemented in C programming languages. These algorithms are used to search for specific elements or values within a given data structure.

## Algorithms

The following search algorithms are included in this directory:

- Binary Search
- Linear Search
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file and is accompanied by a brief explanation of its working principles.

## Usage

To use any of the search algorithms in your own projects, simply copy the corresponding implementation file into your project directory. Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the file's comments for proper usage.
