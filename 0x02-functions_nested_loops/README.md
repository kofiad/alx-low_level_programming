2-print_alphabet_x10.c -  prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Prototype: **void print_alphabet_x10(void);**
You can only use **_putchar** twice in your code

3-islower.c - checks for lowercase character.
Prototype: **int _islower(int c);**
Returns **1** if **c** is lowercase
Returns **0** otherwise

4-isalpha.c - checks for alphabetic character.
Prototype: **int _isalpha(int c);**
Returns **1** if **c** is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
Returns **0** otherwise

5-sign.c - prints the sign of a number.
Prototype: **int print_sign(int n);**
Returns **1** and prints **+** if **n** is greater than zero
Returns **0** and prints **0** if **n** is zero
Returns **-1** and prints **-** if **n** is less than zero

6-abs.c - computes the absolute value of an integer.
Prototype: **int _abs(int);**

7-print_last_digit.c -  prints the last digit of a number.
